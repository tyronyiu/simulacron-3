            <h2 id="1">What is Adid?</h2>

            <!--
                <h3 class="t-center"><b>Adid is an app that connects
                people.</b></h3>
            -->
            <div class="minispacer"></div>
            <h4 class="caption"><b>Adid is an app that connects people.</b></h4>
            <div class="minispacer"></div>

            <p>
            Adid's goal is to dissolve the barrier of exchanging contact
            details. Traditional contact exchange and sharing methods, such as
            business cards, oral transcription or manual typing are not private,
            convenient or contemporary. With <em>Adid</em> the whole process of
            exchanging contact information, names, phone number, email,
            Instagram account name et cetera takes <b>~1-3 seconds</b>. Go
            ahead and try typing or dictating all that into your contacts app in
            less than three seconds.
            </p>

            <h2 id="2">How it works</h2>
            <p>
            Simply enter all the contact information you wish to share with
            someone and the app generates your personal qr code, ready to be
            scanned at all times. You scan that qr code with a qr code scanner
            (if you have an iphone, you can use its native camera) and your
            phone will ask you to save the scanned code's data in your contacts
            app. <br />
            The scanning process works without having to have the Adid app
            installed. <em>It's agnostic.</em> Adid uses standardised protocols and
            markup formats for encoding people's contact data. Thus, you could
            scan an Adid generated code with, like 90% of all devices and expect
            full functionality, even a 1990's device. <br />
            </p>

            <h2 id="3">Convenience, Security & Speed</h2>

            <p>
            The barrier to connecting should be as low as possible. Adid is
            built upon the three values of convenience, security and speed,
            effectively lowering barriers to connections. When there is a
            connection to be shared, non-functioning tech or other barriers are
            unacceptable.<br />
            </p>
            
            <div class="minispacer"></div>
            <h4  class="caption"><b>Private & Secure, please!</b></h4>
            <div class="minispacer"></div>

            <p>
            To be joked about, but yet so vital to some services. Contact
            information, corporate or private, is possibly the most vital
            data to be secured, besides banking information maybe. Thus, not
            sending them unencrypted via the web or storing them as such seems
            idiotic. Encrypting traffic end-to-end and storing fragmented at
            secure sites is better. Not involving any internet traffic at all,
            keeping all data on the device and not storing them anywhere other
            than your own device is what Adid does.
            </p>
            <p>
            Speed and convenience are ensured by outsourcing all tedious tasks
            associated with contact info exchange to machines. Computer vision
            algorithms take care of decrypting data that encoded in a qr code.
            All of that done in less than 3 seconds is what I'd call quick and
            convenient.
            </p>

            <h2 id="4">Open Source Software</h2>
            <p>
            I am a firm believer in the collective benefits of <em> open source
            </em> and as such built Adid with that concept in mind.<br />
            Human connections and connecting with each other shouldn't cost a
            dime, that is why Adid is 100% free and ad-free.
            </p>

            <div class="minispacer"></div>
            <h4  class="caption"><b>Adid works offline!</b></h4>
            <div class="minispacer"></div>

            <p>
            Adid is fully functional without requiring internet access. Not only
            the code generation side of the process, but also the scanning and
            importing into the contacts app works offline. This makes Adid a
            perfect tool for remote areas and decentralised usage. The aspect of
            decentralisation is a main pillar for Adid's value concept.
            </p>
