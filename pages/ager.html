            <h2 id="3">Control Modules</h2>
            <p>
            Our modules are designed in-house and its housings are 3d printed, mass produced
            using injection moulding or crafted from wood. They are then carefully assembled
            and adapted for client use cases. Fitted in leather, metal-like plated or
            painted our modules can then make their way to their deployment site. 
            </p>
            <div class="smvspacer"></div>

            <h2 id="4">Technology</h2>
            <p>
            We leverage the technology used to create wireless payment methods like apple
            pay, pay'n'pass and similar to trigger useful actions on a phone or display
            relevant information, when it is brought into the proximity of one of our
            control modules.  The action to execute or content to be shared can easily be
            altered via a currently in-development app directly from a phone.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thus, commonly it relieves the internet and servers of traffic or less common,
            provide vital decentralised digital infrastructure for off-grid, poorly
            connected or disaster environments.
            </p>
            <h3>B2B centric applications</h3>
            <p>
            The technology doesn't require an internet connection per se, which allows for
            many niche use cases.  Introducing the internet into the mix opens up all today
            possible actions to be executed - the possibilities are limited to imagination
            of application.
            </p>
            <h3>Customer centric applications</h3>
            <p>
            A decentralised, locally used, portable device that is easily readable can share
            data between mobile devices without internet. That is the second major
            application of our technology and our modules.  Two users with our modules could
            exchange contact details solely by scanning each other's module, which is done
            through phone-module proximity.
            </p>
            <div class="smvspacer"></div>

            <h2 id="5">Use Cases</h2>
            <h3>Regular scenario of use</h3>
            <p>
            One of our modules is approached by a phone. Within close proximity the user is
            prompted to allow a pre-programmed action to execute.
            </p>
            <p>
            These actions can be as simple as a sole message or varyingly complex.
            </p>
            <p>
            A customer in a store could get further instructions, help, related &
            complementary products directly from the packaging of a product on the shelf.
            </p>

            <h3>Use locally stationed</h3>
            <p>
            A semi-permanently placed module fosters habitual interaction and eases
            identification, thus best used as brand addition.
            </p>
            <p>
            Located on the hotel lobby counter, a module can easily become the simplest &
            recognised way to connect to the guest Wifi.
            </p>
            <p>
            At events they can be used to register attendees or function as a informational
            terminal.
            </p>
            <h3>Use portable as accessoire</h3>
            <p>
            Adding an extra layer of security to a firm by storing a long password or
            logging employee shifts can be multi-functional module uses.
            </p>
            <p>
            Having individuals use the module as a temporary data storage device to be
            altered swiftly yields max utility.

            <h3>Digital Portfolio -- VIC</h3>
            <p>
            A live example that you will soon be able to get your hands on is a web app that
            generates a website with given contact & portfolio details. This website is then
            linked to one of our modules. The user can then easily share their details by
            routing the recipient to said website, when they approach the proximity of the
            module.

            <h3>In-situ deployment in restaurants</h3>
            <p>
            Another soon to be seen live example is a module on the tables in a restaurant,
            swiftly adding digital functionality. Such a use case could display the menu
            card or replace paper receipts. The demo video showcases the variety of this
            technology for use cases. Different levels of interaction with the customer or
            potential customer are possible and enables retention increase potential.
