            <p>
            Time is a very valuable resource, if not the most valuable. Thus, it
            is imperative to be time efficient. Using the right tools for the
            right job / problem is the beginning, being able to choose from a
            variety of tools for a multitude of problems and using them in the
            most efficient way is the final form.<br />
            </p>

            <p>
            Over on my <a href="https://medium.com/@stellarblog">medium</a>, I've made a few posts about the
            tools that I use to solve uncommon, but otherwise annoying and very
            common problems. <br /><br />

            Tools like <em>The command line, vim, grep, sed, awk or tmux</em> do
            accelerate my work-flow significantly when compared to a few years
            ago, before having implemented these.
            </p>

            <h2 id="2">Energy usage</h2>

            <p>
            The <em>digital nomadic</em> life, coupled with aspects of
            minimalism, a scalable style of living is found. Not only
            transverses this into an approach for technological development, but
            it can also be applied to sociological foundations.<br /><br />

            Concepts like <em>the venus project, shared / access economy,
                hydrogen economy and basic income</em> are a good start for a
            imagining post-scarcity society's, without compromise between
            democratic and communistic aspects or the loss of capitalism.

            <p>
            When having another look at my <a href="about.html#2">goals</a>, it
            can be seen to align with the assumption of reaching post-scarcity
            society's in our lifetimes. Thus, similarly as <em>spacex</em>
            aiming to accelerate the development towards multi-planetary life,
            some of my goals clearly aim at accelerating development towards
            post-scarcity.
