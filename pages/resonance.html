                Introduction
            </h2>

            <p>
            Resonance started as part of university course <em>"Hacking for
                Startups"</em> and has never left prototyping phase.<br/>
            The during the time of the class developed prototype is able to
            extinguish fire from approx. 1m distance using sound waves - nothing
            else. <br/><br/>
            It is a device usable many times in a row without the need of
            refuelling or maintenance and is therefore much less of a
            sustainable impact to gaseous extinction methods like
            Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).<br/><br/>
            This device is perfectly suited for situations and circumstances in
            which gaseous extinguishing would not be the best option. These
            cases might be: <br/>A space station, in which the atmosphere shall not be
            contaminated; Frequently used CO2 extinguishers could be fatal!<br/>
            A server farm / computing centre in which hydrous liquids could
            damage electronics;<br/> 
            Any situation that needs short-distance automated fire
            extinction.<br/><br/>
            Liquid extinguishing has its drawbacks, mainly damaging its
            surroundings in-situ. <br/>Water damage in domestic, mainly in the
            kitchen originating, fire extinctions account for
            the majority of damages to a home. Thus, sonic fire suppression and
            extinction could be a viable option for insurance corporations
            aiming at lowering costs for fire damage - Having to cover / replace
            only actually by fire damaged goods.

            <h2 id="HowItWorks">
                How it works
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
A flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and
sometimes ultraviolet light. The frequency spectrum of flames depends on the
chemical composition of the burning material and reaction products
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            Thus, the gaseous components of the fire can be altered to change
            the flame in general. This is the underlying concept of
            extinguishing fire, we want to drive away the oxygen molecules from
            the oxidation site and inject more Nitrogen molecules and others to
            "suffocate" the flame.<br/><br/>
            <em>Atmospheric attenuation</em> and <em>vibrational
                frequencies</em> of molecules are the two fundamental concepts
            of how this method works.<br/>
            The vibrational frequency of <em>"air"</em> is utilised to create
            "winds" - changing currents in the composition of the
            atmosphere.<br/>
            These currents, when directed at a flame, are strong enough to drive
            away oxygen molecules and effectively stops the fire.
